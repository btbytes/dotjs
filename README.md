This is my `$HOME/.js` directory for the `dotjs` Firefox extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dotjs/

Using the "dotjs" extension and these files, you can style the webpages you frequent. Many sites have annoying styling and/or advertisements. 

You can hide the parts, enhance the typography to make the reading a tad more pleasant.
